  <div class="stackedit__html"><p>Hello Tamers!</p>
<h1 id="season-2-introduction">Season 2 Introduction</h1>
<p>Season 2 will work slightly differently from our first, as we are adopting an <strong>“open-season format.”</strong></p>
<p>What does this mean for you, the players?</p>
<p>Simply put — we’re shifting the focus toward the most important upcoming aspect of the project: <strong>collecting items that will be used in the Tamer Forge.</strong></p>
<h3 id="key-points-to-note">Key points to note:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There will be no specified end date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will announce more frequent reward periods for Tamers on the leaderboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number of development patches will be introduced over the course of Season 2.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, without further ado…on to what’s new!</p>
<h1 id="season-2-changes">Season 2 Changes</h1>
<p>Here’s a rundown of what will be released as part of our Season 2 rollout:</p>
<h2 id="part-1-23082025">Part 1 (23/08/2025)</h2>
<h3 id="mission-points-formula-changes">1. Mission Points Formula Changes</h3>
<p>We’ve been hard at work revamping our mission points formula, with a focus on rewarding effort and smart team selection.</p>
<p>Back in Season 1, our formula was:</p>
<p><strong>Points = (Base Points × Tier Multiplier) + Synergy Bonus (Recommended Archetypes) + Mission Completion Modifiers</strong></p>
<p>This led to many players favoring Basic Mission spam, with little incentive to field stronger teams.</p>
<p>The updated formula introduces the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>(UPDATE) Mission Tier Multiplier:</strong> Adjusted to better differentiate basic vs. higher-tier missions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(NEW) Flat Mission Tier Bonuses:</strong> Extra points awarded for higher-tier missions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(NEW) Personality Synergy Bonus:</strong> More points for higher-synergy teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(NEW) Streak Bonus:</strong> A multi-level bonus for completing missions of the same type 3+ times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(NEW) Critical Success:</strong> A small chance to earn <strong>2× mission points.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(NEW) Jackpot:</strong> A small chance to gain bonus points and a <strong>+1 ultra item roll.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mission-reward-bonuses">2. Mission Reward Bonuses</h3>
<p><strong>(NEW) Party Composition Bonuses:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unified Blessing:</strong> +20% Paw, +10% Rare Item Chance, +1 Additional Item Roll</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Resonant Overdrive:</strong> +15% Paw, +15% Rare Item Chance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tension Surge:</strong> +10% Paw, +10% Rare Item Chance, +1 Additional Item Roll</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase Harmony:</strong> +10% Paw, +5% Rare Item Chance</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please Note: These particular bonuses are <strong>NOT</strong> stackable.</p>
<p>These bonuses join the already existing stack of bonuses and they are designed to reward diverse team comps and playstyles.</p>
<h3 id="ui-rewards-screen">3. UI: Rewards Screen</h3>
<p>We’ve added a <strong>Mission Completion Rewards screen</strong>, showing a full breakdown of your mission loot and unlocked bonuses.</p>
<p>Flex in front of your rivals by sharing directly to Twitter!</p>
<h2 id="part-2-tbc">Part 2 (TBC)</h2>
<h3 id="mission-stamina">4. Mission Stamina</h3>
<p>We will soon introduce a <strong>daily stamina system</strong> for missions. Each mission will consume stamina, and once depleted you’ll need to wait for the daily reset…<strong>unless you replenish it.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>PAW Refills:</strong> Up to <strong>3 full restores per day</strong> with PAW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>KTTY Refills:</strong> After PAW is used, KTTY can restore stamina. The first few refills restore <strong>full stamina</strong>, but subsequent ones restore only <strong>50%.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This system makes PAW the daily driver while keeping KTTY as a premium option for extended play without breaking balance.</p>
<h3 id="risk-re-roll-mechanic">5. Risk Re-roll Mechanic</h3>
<p>You’ll be able to re-roll your mission rewards using <strong>PAW</strong> or <strong>KTTY</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>PAW Re-Roll:</strong> Riskier - you may lose some rewards, keep them, or boost them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>KTTY Re-Roll:</strong> Premium and safer - you’ll either keep or boost rewards, never lose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="removal-of-4-tamer-requirement">6. Removal of 4-Tamer Requirement</h3>
<p>To expand farming options, missions will soon allow as few as <strong>1 Tamer.</strong></p>
<p>Synergy remains key: 4-Tamer parties will still offer the best rewards, but synergy bonuses will still be achievable with <strong>2 or 3-Tamer teams.</strong></p>
<h3 id="mission-duration-reduction">7. Mission Duration Reduction</h3>
<p>You’ll soon be able to spend <strong>PAW</strong> or <strong>KTTY</strong> to reduce mission durations, up to a cap announced at launch.</p>
<h3 id="attendance-calendar">8. Attendance Calendar</h3>
<p>We’re introducing a <strong>30-day Daily Attendance Calendar</strong> to reward Tamers for consistent logins.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Daily Rewards:</strong> Useful items and resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Weekly Bonuses:</strong> Extra rewards for consecutive attendance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grand Reward:</strong> A major prize on the final day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will provide another way to earn materials in preparation for the <strong>Tamer Forge Update.</strong></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We’ve seen an incredible surge in activity since launch, and we want you to see firsthand the effort we’re putting in to make <strong>Tamer Missions</strong> one of the most rewarding gaming experiences on Ronin.</p>
<p>Your feedback and continued engagement are vital as we take the platform to the next level together.</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
<p><strong>– Dev KTTY</strong></p>
